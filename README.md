# CSCI-306-Web-Design-III

This is my repo for CSCI 306 Web Page Design III class.
Each project/assignment will be a separate branch and will be included in a list here in the README with a link to that branch on GitHub.

## Projects/Assignments
<ul>
  <li> Final Project (SE Project) </li>
  Contributors page should be fairly accurate to what I worked on. I primarily worked on login, initial structure/layout of components, backend Node routes and logic, database schemas, and various bug fixes and features throughout the app on my classmate's pages.
